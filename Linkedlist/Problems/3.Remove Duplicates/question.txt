Remove Duplicates from a Singly Linked List
Given a singly linked list, write a function that removes all the duplicates. use this linked list .

Original Linked List - "1 -> 2 -> 4-> 3 -> 4->2"

Result Linked List - "1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3


There is a other form of the same quetion that is what if the given linked list is sorted 

that means always the duplicates will be adjacent to each other so we dont need the set for comparision
