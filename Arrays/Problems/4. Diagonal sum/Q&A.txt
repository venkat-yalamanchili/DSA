Sum of elements in primary diagonal
Given 2D list calculate the sum of diagonal elements.
Example:
myList2D= [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] 
diagonal_sum(myList2D) # 15

Sum of elements in both primary and secondary elements


2nd Question 
Given a square matrix mat, return the sum of the matrix diagonals.

Only include the sum of all the elements on the primary diagonal and all the elements on the secondary diagonal that are not part of the primary diagonal.

Example 1:

Input: mat = [[1,2,3],
              [4,5,6],
              [7,8,9]]
Output: 25
Explanation: Diagonals sum: 1 + 5 + 9 + 3 + 7 = 25
Notice that element mat[1][1] = 5 is counted only once.
Example 2:

Input: mat = [[1,1,1,1],
              [1,1,1,1],
              [1,1,1,1],
              [1,1,1,1]]
Output: 8
Example 3:

Input: mat = [[5]]
Output: 5


Solution explanation

The diagonal elements in a matrix have a unique property, in that their row and column indices are equal or differ by a constant amount.
Specifically, for a square matrix, the diagonal elements have row and column indices of the form (i, i) or (i, n - i - 1).
Therefore, we can iterate over each row of the matrix, and add the diagonal elements to a running sum.
If the matrix has an odd size, the center element will be part of both diagonals and will be added twice. We can correct this by subtracting it once from the running sum.
Finally, we can return the sum as the answer.
